# Python Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Python Practice Repository**! I'm a beginner diving into Python programming, practicing day by day and topic by topic to build a strong foundation. This repository documents my progress as I work through exercises, mini-projects, and challenges over the upcoming weeks.

## ðŸŒŸ Whatâ€™s This About?
This is my personal learning hub where I:
- Solve Python problems daily.
- Explore key topics like variables, loops, functions, OOP, and more.
- Build small projects to apply what I learn.
- Track my growth and share my code with the world.

Iâ€™m committed to coding consistently and improving my skillsâ€”watch this space grow!

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Iâ€™ve organized my work into folders for easy navigation:
- **Day-wise**: `Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc., for daily coding exercises.
- **Topic-wise**: Folders like `Basics`, `Loops`, `Functions`, `Data Structures`, etc.
- **Projects**: Mini-projects Iâ€™ll build as I progress (e.g., a calculator, to-do list).

Each folder contains Python scripts (`.py`) with comments explaining my thought process.
